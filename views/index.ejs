                <h3>What we do</h3>
                <p>We know that books are more about the knowledge inside than the actual cover. The thought that a slightly used book may be gathering dust on a shelf, or even worse-sent to a landfill- terrifies us. <br>
                  These books can bring learning and joy to a new reader and be friendly on the pocket too! Here at MapMyBook we strive to create a community that can draw on each other for all their book related needs. <br> Whether it be getting competitive exam books for your JEE/NEET preparation, a set for the new school year or just that really cool Enid Blyton novel: weâ€™ve got you covered! Giving new lives to our old books; Welcome to MapMyBook!</p> </div>
